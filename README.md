# U.S. Medical Insurance Analysis

This project explores how lifestyle and demographic factors influence medical insurance charges in the U.S., using a dataset of 1,300+ individuals. It was completed as part of a portfolio-building challenge and visualized using Tableau Public.

---

## üß† Objective

To analyze how medical insurance costs vary based on:

- **Smoking status**
- **Age and age group**
- **BMI**
- **Number of children**
- **Region**

---

## üîç Key Insights

- **Smokers pay nearly 4x more** on average than non-smokers
- **Insurance charges increase with age**, especially after 45
- **The Southeast** has the highest concentration of high-cost individuals
- **BMI has a visible impact**, but not as much as smoking
- **Children have minimal influence** on average charges

---

## üìä Visualizations

The analysis was visualized with Tableau in a 3-part interactive dashboard:

1. **Average Charges by Smoker Status**
2. **Charges by Age Group Across Regions**
3. **BMI vs Charges (Colored by Smoker Status)**
